Bootstrap Image Gallery Exercise

In an effort to familiarize myself with the Bootstrap framework, I created a very basic gallery which focuses on a responsive design and image resizing.  Some key features of the exercise are highlighted below.

NAV-BAR

	Nav-fixed-top - FIXES NAV BAR AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE SO EVEN WHEN SCROLLING DOWN, THE NAV-BAR ALWAYS REMAINS VISIBLE/FIXED AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE.  ALSO ADDED PADDING TO BODY SELECTOR TO MAINTAIN SPACE BETWEEN NAV-BAR & JUMBOTRON

GRID SYSTEM

	.THUMBNAIL - ALLOWS IMAGES OF ALL SIZES TO CONFORM TO THE GRID AND NOT INTERRUPT LAYOUT & ADDS SUBTLE BORDER FOR DECORATION

GLYPHICONS (from Bootstrap as well as Font Awesome)

SPECIFICITY & OVERRIDING DEFAULT BOOTSTRAP STYLES

	INCLUDED CUSTOM CSS FILE AND PLACED AS LINK IN HTML UNDER THE "BOOTSTRAP CSS CDN" LINK SO AS TO OVERRIDE CONFLICTING STYLING OF THE NAV-BAR AND LINKS NESTED INSIDE THE NAV-BAR
